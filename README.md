# momo-scheduler <img src="momo_logo.svg" align="right" />

momo is a light-weight, easy-to-use scheduler that persists jobs in a MongoDB and supports interval-based scheduling as
well as cron syntax. In essence, it provides an easy way to tell your application to either "run that job every five
minutes" or "run that job according to this cron schedule".

## Features

- allows concurrent jobs
- allows immediate jobs
- supports long-running jobs
- allows error handling
- allows updating jobs during runtime
- supports cluster mode (e.g. several services using the same job database)

## Installation

Install via npm:

```
npm install @tngtech/momo-scheduler
```

or yarn:

```
yarn add @tngtech/momo-scheduler
```

You're all set!

## Usage

```typescript
import { MongoSchedule, MomoJob, MomoJobBuilder, MomoErrorEvent, MomoEvent } from 'momo-scheduler';
import { MongoMemoryServer } from 'mongodb-memory-server';

const mongo = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
const mongoSchedule = await MongoSchedule.connect({ url: await mongo.getUri() });

const intervalJob: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('interval job')
  .withConcurrency(2)
  .withMaxRunning(3)
  .withSchedule('5 seconds')
  .withHandler(() => logger.error('This is a momo job that runs once every five seconds!'))
  .build();

const cronJob: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('interval job')
  .withConcurrency(1)
  .withMaxRunning(1)
  .withCronShcedule('0 0 * * *')
  .withHandler(() => logger.error('This is a momo job that runs every day at midnight!'))
  .build();

await mongoSchedule.define(intervalJob);
await mongoSchedule.define(cronJob);

// optional: listen to error and debug events
mongoSchedule.on('error', (error: MomoErrorEvent) => {
  /* handle error */
});
mongoSchedule.on('debug', (debug: MomoEvent) => {
  /* ... */
});

await mongoSchedule.start();

// ...

await mongoSchedule.disconnect();
```

### MomoJob

You can instantiate a momo job using the `MomoJobBuilder` class. It provides the following setter methods:

| setter           | parameters                       | mandatory | default value | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### MongoSchedule

The start/stop/cancel/remove methods can take a job's name as an optional parameter.
Only the job with the provided name is started/stopped/cancelled/removed.
If there is no job with this name on the schedule, nothing is done.
If the parameter is omitted, all jobs are started/stopped/cancelled/removed.

| collectionsPrefix | `string` | true     | no prefix | A prefix for all collections created by Momo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| pingInterval      | number   | true     | `60`      | The keep alive ping interval of the schedule, in seconds.

You might want to reduce this if you have jobs running on very short intervals. |

#### MomoJobDescription

The job description returned by the `list` and `get` functions of the `MongoSchedule` contains the following properties:

| property        | type                                    | optional | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name            | `string`                                | false    | The name of the job. Used as a unique identifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| interval        | `string`                                | false    | Specifies the time interval at which the job is started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| concurrency     | `number`                                | false    | How many instances of a job are started at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| maxRunning      | `number`                                | false    | Maximum number of job executions that is allowed at a time. Set to 0 for no max. The job will not be started anymore if maxRunning is reached.                                                                                                                                                                |
| schedulerStatus | `{ interval: string, running: number }` | true     | Only present if the job was started, reports the number of currently running executions of the job and the time interval at which job execution is triggered. This might differ from the top-level `interval` as the interval of an already started job is not changed automatically when the job is updated. |

The MongoSchedule is an EventEmitter, emitting `'debug'` and `'error'` events.
You can define callbacks to handle them:

```typescript
mongoSchedule.on('error', ({ error, data, message, type }: MomoErrorEvent) => {
  console.log(`An error of type ${type} occurred`, { error, data, message });
});

mongoSchedule.on('debug', ({ data, message }: MomoEvent) => {
  console.log('A debug event occurred', { data, message });
});
```

### MomoEvent and MomoErrorEvent

| event | property         | type                     | description                                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| both  | message          | `string`                 | Some information about the event that occurred.                                                                                               |
| both  | data (optional)  | `{ name?: string; ... }` | Contains additional information like the name of the affected job.                                                                            |
| error | type             | `MomoErrorType`          | one of: `'defining job failed'`, `'scheduling job failed'`, `'executing job failed'`, `'stopping job failed'`, `'an internal error occurred'` |
| error | error (optional) | `Error`                  | The root cause of the error.                                                                                                                  |

### Job Examples

```typescript
import { MomoJobBuilder } from './MomoJobBuilder';

const example1: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 1')
  .withInterval('5 minutes')
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'));

const example2: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 2')
  .withInterval('5 minutes', 60 * 1000) // first run after one minute
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'));

const example3: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 3')
  .withInterval('5 minutes', 5 * 60 * 1000) // first run after five minutes
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'));

const example4: MomoJob = new MomoJobBuilder()
  .withName('example 4')
  .withCronSchedule('0 0 * * *') // every day at midnight
  .withHandler(() => console.log('This is momo'));
```

Assume it is 12:00 AM when the MongoSchedule with these four example jobs is started.

- `example 1` will be run immediately, at 12:00, and then every five minutes. Adding `firstRunAfter: 0` explicitly is equivalent as this is the default value.
- `example 2` will be run after 1 minute (the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:01, and then every five minutes.
- `example 3` will be run after 5 minutes (the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:05, and then every five minutes.
- `example 4` will be run at midnight every day

Now assume the MongoSchedule is stopped at 12:02 and then immediately started again.

- `example 1` will be run 5 minutes (the configured `interval`) after the last execution, at 12:05. The job is NOT run immediately because it already ran before.
- `example 2` will be run 5 minutes (the configured `interval`) after the last execution, at 12:06. The job is NOT run after 1 minute (the configured `firstRunAfter`) because it already ran before.
- `example 3` will be run 5 minutes after the start (because of the the configured `firstRunAfter`), at 12:07, because it never ran before, and then every five minutes.
- `example 4` will be run at midnight every day
